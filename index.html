    <p class="font">The Cherry Project aims to empower artists to create art unbounded by traditional conventions, free from censorship, and independent from the whims of the powers that be: we are striving to make artistic expression accessible to all. To achieve this goal, our technology must first and foremost be accessible and easy to use. We feel everyone should be able to use the Cherry Chain, including legacy and third party web3 systems. In this article we focus on the efforts Cherry has made to facilitate the use of our platform for developers and users alike.</p>
       
         <h3>Open, trustless networking</h3>
         <p>One of the main innovations of blockchain technology is the introduction of decentralized systems where participants rely on laws written in code instead of trusting centralized authorities. This remarkable property allows people from across the world to transact and establish agreements without necessarily knowing or trusting their counterparties. The Cherry Chain indeed stands as a microcosm of reliable and unbiased enforcement of shared truths which are transparently established and explicitly agreed upon by all participants in the Network. While we firmly believe that everything will soon be stored on the blockchain and make use of these features, this is currently not the case. Information is scattered across systems, and applications are forced to choose one infrastructure over all others in order to interact with their users. This fragmented landscape makes development of new features, and their use by end users, problematic.</p>
         
           <p>The Cherry team understands these challenges, as well as the lack of a one-size-fits-all solution. This is why a primary design requirement for the Cherry Chain was to make it compatible with Ethereum, the most popular decentralized applications platform, and interoperable with as many web3 layer-1 blockchain networks as possible. Compatibility allows developers to replicate their applications and deploy them on the Cherry Chain with no additional modification; interoperability allows disparate networks to communicate and share information in a decentralized non-authoritative way.</p>

              <h3>Oracles, compatibility & interoperability</h3>
              <p>The advantage of being compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is clear: developers only need to maintain a single codebase in a single language (e.g. Solidity), which they can deploy on Cherry Chain just like they do on Ethereum. Their dApp will work as it does on Ethereum, only for much cheaper since the Cherry Chain user base is still growing and its resources aren’t in such competitive demand as Ethereum's.</p>

                <p>The interoperability property, instead, has much more interesting implications. If you think of a blockchain as a self-contained state machine, one would naturally wonder how  it is possible to update the common state with new data, especially when the data originated outside the network, and thus is extrinsic. Such data must somehow be verified and translated into actionable information. However, the network peers have no standardized way of agreeing on its veracity or meaning. For example the weather in London, UK may be reported to be 18 C°, but peers from Los Angeles, USA cannot independently verify that the temperature is correct, and may struggle interpreting the centigrade degree scale over Fahrenheit. Extensive research has gone into this subject; conventionally, the agents that translate arbitrary, unstructured data into useful information are called oracles. We will be publishing an article that delves into oracles and their use in the Cherry Chain soon.
                  The difficulty with oracles is the degree of trust one must place in the processes that lead to their conclusions. The oracle operator may be compromised, or act maliciously by conspiring with one of the two parties which rely on its information to, for example, source the price of an asset in the context of an exchange. More innocently, there may simply be a compromising bug in their code. The more interpretation an oracle must carry out, the more trust users must place in its developers and operators.

                    There is however a data source which is constant and which may be trusted unconditionally: other blockchains. This is where interoperability steps in: the property of a blockchain to be able to understand and communicate with another network, typically another blockchain, in a trustless manner. A lack of interoperability means blockchains are mostly unable to communicate with each other across networks, making it difficult for users of one network to interact with the other.

                      Interoperability is critical for the mass adoption of decentralized applications. Users need to be able to interact and collaborate across different platforms, leveraging the different features and characteristics of each. Outside of the blockchain world, interoperability is crucial for all interconnected software systems which would not function without strict rules for interacting with each other. Interoperability between blockchains enables better experiences for both users and developers through easier smart contract execution, better information sharing, more partnership opportunities, and implementation of cross-chain solutions.</P>

                      <h3>Cherry Chain: interoperable by design</h3>
                      <p>From the beginning, developers working on Cherry Network focused on creating a scalable and interoperable platform. Our team understood how important interoperability is for the blockchain industry as a whole, and for the long term success of the Cherry Chain. We needed to create a platform that developers could easily integrate with their projects if they choose to do so. By allowing developers to easily extend their blockchain applications to take advantage of the unique features of the Cherry Chain we are helping move the entire blockchain industry towards mass adoption.

                        An additional, more practical benefit that these design features produce is a speedy onramp for decentralized applications to start using Cherry Chain with no additional modification. A high level of compatibility allows for a transitory period in which developers may get acquainted with Cherry's characteristics, and gradually adapt their apps to leverage them, while still operating their old code as usual. Cherry's focus on developer experience and incremental change is essential for an emerging layer one network. Networks need users to thrive, and Cherry Chain's EVM compatibility, and broad interoperability properties allows anyone to start using Cherry and contribute to the future of creative expression.</p>
